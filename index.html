  <h2>Turning the Rover ✓</h2>

  <p>The rover has a direction attribute. We’ve already provided functions called
  turnLeft and turnRight that receive a rover object as an argument.
  Your job is to turn the rover in the appropriate direction based off of its
  current direction.</p>

  <h4>Examples:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>+ Rover is facing North and turns left => Rover is now facing West</li>
    <li>+ Rover is facing West and turns left => Rover is now facing South</li>
    <li>+ Rover is facing North and turns right => Rover is now facing East.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Begin with the a switch statement. Based off of which function is being called,
  turn the rover in the correct direction based off of its current direction.</p>

  <p>Test these functions using the Chrome Console to make sure they work. Remember,
  the console.log() function can be used to log anything. You can use this to see which
  direction your rover is currently facing.</p>

  <h2>Moving the Rover: Forward ✓</h2>

  <p>Moving forward is a function of the rover’s current direction, and the movement forward.</p>

  <h4>For instance:</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>If the Rover is facing west and moves forward, we would decrease the Rover’s x by 1.</li>
    <li>If the rover is facing north and moves forward, we would decrease the rover’s y by 1.</li>
    <li>If the rover is facing south and moves forward, we would increase the y by 1.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Fill in this logic in the moveForward function. After each movement, console.log the
  rover’s coordinates so you can see where it is positioned.</p>

  <h3>BONUS: 1</h3>

  <h2>Moving the Rover: Backwards ✓</h2>

  <p>If you found the first few iterations of the exercise easy, try implementing the
  following features:</p>

  <p><b>Moving Backwards:</b> Create another function called moveBackward that will move the
  rover back.</p>
  <p>This will be very similiar to the moveForward function.
  Validate Inputs: If we enter a letter into our inputs that isn’t a rover command,
  nothing happens.</p>

  <h4>For example ffzzy would simply move forward twice. Add validation so that the
  inputs must be f, b, r, or l.</h4>

  <h2>Rover Commands ✓</h2>

  <p>Create a function that receives a list of commands. These commands will be the
  first letter of either (f)orward, (r)ight, or (l)eft.</p>

  <h4>To test it, use the string: ‘rffrfflfrff’.</h4>

  <h5>Suggested Approach</h5>

  <p>Use a loop to iterate over the string. Inside of this loop, write a switch or
  if statement to
  call the correct function. For instance,
  if the letter is f, you’re going to want to call the goForward function.</p>

  <h2>Tracking the Rover ✓</h2>

  <p>We want to know where our rover has been. Create a property on the rover object that
  contains the coordinates of the places it has been. Call this property travelLog.</p>

  <p>After each move, push the coordinates of the previous space to the travelLog array.
  After the rover has finished its moves, print out all of the spaces the rover has
  traveled over.</p>

  <h3>BONUS: 2 ✓</h3>

  <p>At some point you may have accidentally run our rover off of the grid.
  If you recall, our grid is 10x10.
  Make sure your rover doesn’t accidentally roam off the map!</p>

  <h3>BONUS: 3</h3>

  <p>The following require you to actually create a grid for the rover to move around on.
  In code, these grids are often represented as two dimensional arrays.</p>

  <h4>3.1 ✓</h4>
  <p><b>Obstacles -</b> Create obstacles for the rover. If the rover’s next move would run
  it into an obstacle, stop it from moving forward and report the obstacle as found with
  console.log.</p>

  <h4>3.1 ✓</h4>
  <p><b>Obstacles -</b> Create obstacles for the rover. If the rover’s next move would run
  it into an obstacle, stop it from moving forward and report the obstacle as found with
  console.log.</p>

  <h4>3.2 (pending)</h4>
  <p><b>Other Rovers -</b> Add additional rovers to the map. Have them take turns moving.
  If one rover isgoing to run into the other, you should stop the rover and
  console.log a message saying so.</p>
